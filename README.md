# MacroMaster
This application was a solo project for my Cross Platform Web Development class. 
In this course, I created a cross platform mobile application using Flutter, Dart, and Google Firebase.
I did not use source code repositories to develop the project, so all code came in at once with no commit comments.
The application is a mobile nutrition app that allows user to enter nutrient values of certain foods and store them in a cloud database using Google Firestore. 
Coursework primarily consisted of five minute weekly check-ins where students reviewed their WIP and closed KanBan items with the instructor.
I recieved an A on this project.
